DevOps is important because it improves how software moves through the entire development process. Instead of separate steps, everything becomes more connected from coding to deployment.

Automation helps teams release updates faster and catch issues earlier, making systems more reliable. Learning DevOps gives a better understanding of how real production environments operate.

It also encourages better communication between teams, which reduces deployment risks.

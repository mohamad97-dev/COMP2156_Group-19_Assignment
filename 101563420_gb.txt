George Brown College is a hands-on school in Toronto that focuses a lot on practical skills instead of just theory. There are tons of programs, especially in tech, business, and trades, and most courses include labs or real-world projects.

For me, GBC is helping me build solid networking and DevOps skills that I can use later in cybersecurity or cloud roles.

Overall, the college prepares students for real industry expectations through practical experience.

Running out of things to say so this is for filler commits.
